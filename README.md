Repository for solutions to select Advent of Code 2018 problems, written primarily (solely?) in Typescript using the TDD red-green-refactor approach.

### Edit and Run
Write your program using `src/index.ts` as the entry point, and run it.

```bash
$ npm run start
```

Individual problems will be split out into standalone modules.

#### How to TDD:

Create a test file next to the file you want to test, using the nomenclature `<file-name>.test.ts`.

```bash
$ npm run tdd
```
